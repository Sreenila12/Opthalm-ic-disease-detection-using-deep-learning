# Opthalm-ic-disease-detection-using-deep-learning
Ophthalmic disease detection using deep learning focuses on identifying eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts from retinal images. Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to analyze medical images and automatically detect disease patterns with high accuracy.
